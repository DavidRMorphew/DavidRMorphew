## Hello and Welcome!

I'm David. I am a software engineer at Nexient, LLC. I work in TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Redux, Vue, Vuex, and Ruby on Rails (as well as SQL, ActiveRecord, HTML, and CSS).

I love building and brainstorming new projects, learning new languages and coding patterns, and puzzling through challenges.

I also love to talk about code: I used to work as a `Technical Coach` part-time for Flatiron School, where I would pair-program with students to guide them in solving coding problems through questions and by explaining coding concepts.

## Background

Before I discovered software engineering, I used to work in academic research, writing, and editing. I also studied and taught languages. Those skills transfer surprisingly well to coding:  
- ‚ö° creativity in building new features
- ü§î logic used in control flow 
- ‚úíÔ∏è syntax and editing  to write clear and clean code

## In Progress

I'm building out the basics of a Stoics Journal App, which shows a snippet of Stoic wisdom for a user to read and respond to with the in-app journal. The idea is to make it easy for people to engage with ancient texts and what they think about the ideas expressed. Todos for the app: I'm adding free translations of ancient Stoic texts by Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, and Seneca. I've been working on formatting and persisting the texts as sections that serve as daily quotes. Next, I'll build a frontend to present a random quote for the user to read and to journal a response to, which can be saved in the API for the user to access later.

I'm also working on updating the [My Bricks App](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-frontend) to use context and React hooks patterns and to optimize my backend matching feature.

More will be in the works soon.
