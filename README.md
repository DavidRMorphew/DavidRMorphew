## Hello and Welcome!

I'm David. I am an AI Senior Engineer in the AI - ML - Data Transformation Department at NTT Data. I work to integrate AI and Machine Learning tooling for Code Transformation and Acceleration and Data Analysis. I have a strong background in application engineering, particularly in Python, Ruby on Rails, SQL in JavaScript development (TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Redux, Vue, Vuex).

In my current client projects, I work with a tech stack of Python, PySpark Notebooks in Microsoft Fabric, React + Typescript, .NET (C#), SQL Server, and Microsoft Fabric Delta tables for AI Proof of Concept projects. I recently built a PySpark implementation for batch processing unstructured data into structured data using LLMs. I previously also have worked on UI builds for Retrieval Augmented Generate AI projects, and I build local AI tooling for task automation using locally hosted AI models via Ollama.

I love building and brainstorming new projects with AI, learning new languages and coding patterns, and puzzling through challenges.

I also love to talk about code: I used to work as a `Technical Coach` part-time for Flatiron School, where I would pair-program with students to guide them in solving coding problems through questions and by explaining coding concepts.

## Background

Before I discovered software engineering, I earned a PhD in Classics and an MA in Philosophy, and I used to work in research, writing, and editing (_Oxford Studies in Ancient Philosophy_). I also studied and taught languages. Those skills transfer surprisingly well to coding:

- ‚ö° creativity in building new features
- ü§î logic used in control flow
- ‚úíÔ∏è syntax and editing to write clear and clean code

## In Progress

I have a few private repos where I build out AI Chatbots and work on other AI projects.

I recently started a quick reverse-engineer build of gitMCP for local usage ([local-git-mcp](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/local-git-mcp)).

In my public repos, I working on updating old apps, such as [My Bricks App](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-frontend), which has a basic Ruby backend and algorithm search and React UI to help users catalogue the Lego sets they own and discover instructions for sets they can build with the bricks they already own.
