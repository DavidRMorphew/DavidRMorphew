## Hello and Welcome!

I'm David. I am an AI engineer and senior software engineer in the AI - ML - Data Transformation Department at NTT Data. I work to integrate AI and Machine Learning tooling for Code Transformation and Acceleration, and Data Analysis. I have a strong background in application engineering, particularly in JavaScript development (TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Redux, Vue, Vuex), and in Python, Ruby on Rails, and SQL.

I am currently working with a tech-stack of Python, PySpark Notebooks in Microsoft Fabric, React + Typescript, .NET (C#), SQL Server, and Microsoft Fabric database tables for AI Proof of Concept projects. I have previously also worked on UI builds for Retrieval Augmented Generate AI projects, and I build local AI tooling for task automation using locally hosted AI models via Ollama.

I love building and brainstorming new projects, learning new languages and coding patterns, and puzzling through challenges. AI project open the door even wider.

I also love to talk about code: I used to work as a `Technical Coach` part-time for Flatiron School, where I would pair-program with students to guide them in solving coding problems through questions and by explaining coding concepts.

## Background

Before I discovered software engineering, I earned a PhD in Classics and an MA in Philosophy, and I used to work in research, writing, and editing. I also studied and taught languages. Those skills transfer surprisingly well to coding:

- ‚ö° creativity in building new features
- ü§î logic used in control flow
- ‚úíÔ∏è syntax and editing to write clear and clean code

## In Progress

I have a few private repos where I build out AI Chatbots and work on other AI projects.

In my public repos, I working on updating old apps, such as [My Bricks App](https://github.com/DavidRMorphew/my-bricks-app-frontend), which has a basic Ruby backend and algorithm search and React UI to help users catalogue the Lego sets they own and discover instructions for sets they can build with the bricks they already own.
